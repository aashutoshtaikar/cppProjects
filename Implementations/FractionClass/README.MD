# A Fraction class which performs:
1. Accepts a long double
2. Removes the decimal points
3. User has a simplify option to reduce it to simplest form
4. (WIP) User can make the denominator common using LCM method     


### functions:
#### operators:  
addition +  
subtraction -  
multiplication *  
division /  

#### relational operators:  
greater than > , greater than or equal >=  
less than < , less than or equal <=  
is_equal ==  
not equal !=  

#### casting operators:  
casts to integer (int)  
casts to float (float)  
casts to double (double)  

#### other functions:  


##### this modifiers:

### WIP
AST for string input   
Mixed fractions display  
GCD (handle multiples using initializer list / var template)  
LCM (handle multiples using initializer list / var template)
