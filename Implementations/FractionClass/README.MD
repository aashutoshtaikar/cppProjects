# A Fraction class which performs:
1. Accepts a long double
2. Removes the decimal points
3. User has a simplify option to reduce it to simplest form
(WIP)4. User can make the denominator common using LCM method   


### functions:
addition +  
subtraction -  
multiplication *  
division /  
simplify  
reciprocal  
gcd   

### WIP
AST for string input   
Mixed fractions display  
GCD (handle multiples using initializer list / template)  
LCM (handle multiples using initializer list / template)
