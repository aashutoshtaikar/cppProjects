/*  When is user-defined copy constructor needed?
If we donâ€™t define our own copy constructor, the C++ compiler creates 
a default copy constructor for each class which does a member-wise 
copy between objects. The compiler created copy constructor works 
fine in general. We need to define our own user defined copy constructor only 
if an object has pointers or any runtime allocation of the resource 
like file handle, a network connection..etc.  */
